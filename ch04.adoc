[[coordinate-types, Chapter 4, Coordinate Types]]
==  Coordinate Types 

The commonest use of coordinate variables is to locate the data in space and time, but coordinates may be provided for any other continuous geophysical quantity (e.g. density, temperature, radiation wavelength, zenith angle of radiance, sea surface wave frequency) or discrete category (see <<discrete-axis>>, e.g. area type, model level number, ensemble member number) on which the data variable depends.

Four types of coordinates receive special treatment by these conventions: latitude, longitude, vertical, and time.
We continue to support the special role that the **`units`** and **`positive`** attributes play in the COARDS convention to identify coordinate type.
As an extension to COARDS, we strongly recommend that a parametric (usually dimensionless) vertical coordinate variable should be associated, via **`standard_name`** and **`formula_terms`** attributes, with its explicit definition, which provides a mapping between its values and dimensional vertical coordinate values that can be uniquely located with respect to a point on the earth's surface.

Because identification of a coordinate type by its units is complicated by requiring the use of an external package <<UDUNITS>>, we provide two optional methods that yield a direct identification.
The attribute **`axis`** may be attached to a coordinate variable and given one of the values **`X`**, **`Y`**, **`Z`** or **`T`** which stand for a longitude, latitude, vertical, or time axis respectively.
Alternatively the **`standard_name`** attribute may be used for direct identification.
But note that these optional attributes are in addition to the required COARDS metadata.

To identify generic spatial coordinates we recommend that the **`axis`** attribute be attached to these coordinates and given one of the values **`X`**, **`Y`** or **`Z`**.
The values **`X`** and **`Y`** for the axis attribute should be used to identify horizontal coordinate variables.
If both X- and Y-axis are identified, **`X-Y-up`** should define a right-handed coordinate system, i.e. rotation from the positive X direction to the positive Y direction is anticlockwise if viewed from above.
We strongly recommend that coordinate variables be used for all coordinate types whenever they are applicable.

The methods of identifying coordinate types described in this section apply both to coordinate variables and to auxiliary coordinate variables named by the **`coordinates`** attribute (see <<coordinate-system>>).

The values of a coordinate variable or auxiliary coordinate variable indicate the locations of the gridpoints.
The locations of the boundaries between cells are indicated by bounds variables (see <<cell-boundaries>>).
If bounds are not provided, an application might reasonably assume the gridpoints to be at the centers of the cells, but we do not require that in this standard.

[[latitude-coordinate, Section 4.1, "Latitude Coordinate"]]
=== Latitude Coordinate

Variables representing latitude must always explicitly include the **`units`** attribute; there is no default value.
The recommended value of the **`units`** attribute is the string **`degrees_north`**. Also accepted are **`degree_north`**, **`degree_N`**, **`degrees_N`**, **`degreeN`**, and **`degreesN`**.

[[latitude-axis-ex]]
[caption="Example 4.1. "]
.Latitude axis
====

----

float lat(lat) ;
  lat:long_name = "latitude" ;
  lat:units = "degrees_north" ;
  lat:standard_name = "latitude" ;

----

====

Application writers should note that the UDUNITS package does not recognize the directionality implied by the "north" part of the unit specification.
It only recognizes its size, i.e., 1 degree is defined to be pi/180 radians.
Hence, determination that a coordinate is a latitude type should be done via a string match between the given unit and one of the acceptable forms of **`degrees_north`**.


Optionally, the latitude type may be indicated additionally by providing the **`standard_name`** attribute with the value **`latitude`**, and/or the **`axis`** attribute with the value **`Y`**.

Coordinates of latitude with respect to a rotated pole should be given units of **`degrees`**, not **`degrees_north`** or equivalents, because applications which use the units to identify axes would have no means of distinguishing such an axis from real latitude, and might draw incorrect coastlines, for instance.

[[longitude-coordinate, Section 4.2, "Longitude Coordinate"]]
=== Longitude Coordinate

Variables representing longitude must always explicitly include the **`units`** attribute; there is no default value.
The recommended value of the **`units`** attribute is the string **`degrees_east`**. Also accepted are **`degree_east`**, **`degree_E`**, **`degrees_E`**, **`degreeE`**, and **`degreesE`**.



[[longitude-axis-ex]]

.Longitude axis
====

----

float lon(lon) ;
  lon:long_name = "longitude" ;
  lon:units = "degrees_east" ;
  lon:standard_name = "longitude" ;

----

====

Application writers should note that the UDUNITS package has limited recognition of the directionality implied by the "east" part of the unit specification.
It defines **`degrees_east`** to be pi/180 radians, and hence equivalent to **`degrees_north`**.
We recommend the determination that a coordinate is a longitude type should be done via a string match between the given unit and one of the acceptable forms of **`degrees_east`**.

Optionally, the longitude type may be indicated additionally by providing the **`standard_name`** attribute with the value **`longitude`**, and/or the **`axis`** attribute with the value **`X`**.

Coordinates of longitude with respect to a rotated pole should be given units of **`degrees`**, not **`degrees_east`** or equivalents, because applications which use the units to identify axes would have no means of distinguishing such an axis from real longitude, and might draw incorrect coastlines, for instance.

[[vertical-coordinate, Section 4.3, "Vertical Coordinate"]]
=== Vertical (Height or Depth) Coordinate

Variables representing dimensional height or depth axes must always explicitly include the **`units`** attribute; there is no default value.

The direction of positive (i.e., the direction in which the coordinate values are increasing), whether up or down, cannot in all cases be inferred from the units.
The direction of positive is useful for applications displaying the data.
For this reason the attribute **`positive`** as defined in the COARDS standard is required if the vertical axis units are not a valid unit of pressure (as determined by the UDUNITS package <<UDUNITS>>) -- otherwise its inclusion is optional.
The **`positive`** attribute may have the value **`up`** or **`down`** (case insensitive).
This attribute may be applied to either coordinate variables or auxiliary coordinate variables that contain vertical coordinate data.

For example, if an oceanographic netCDF file encodes the depth of the surface as 0 and the depth of 1000 meters as 1000 then the axis would use attributes as follows: 

----
axis_name:units = "meters" ; 
axis_name:positive = "down" ; 	
----

If, on the other hand, the depth of 1000 meters were represented as -1000 then the value of the **`positive`** attribute would have been **`up`**.
If the **`units`** attribute value is a valid pressure unit the default value of the **`positive`** attribute is **`down`**.

A vertical coordinate will be identifiable by:

* units of pressure; or
* the presence of the **`positive`** attribute with a value of **`up`** or **`down`** (case insensitive).

Optionally, the vertical type may be indicated additionally by providing the **`standard_name`** attribute with an appropriate value, and/or the **`axis`** attribute with the value **`Z`**. 
If both **`positive`** and **`standard_name`** are provided, it is recommended that they should be consistent. 
For instance, if a depth of 1000 metres is represented by -1000 and **`positive`** is **`up`**, it would be inconsistent to give the **`standard_name`** as **`depth`**, whose definition (vertical distance below the surface) implies positive down. 
If an application detects such an inconsistency, the user should be warned, and the **`positive`** attribute should be used to determine the sign convention.

Recommendations:  The **`positive`** attribute should be consistent with the sign convention implied by the definition of the **`standard_name`**, if both are provided.

==== Dimensional Vertical Coordinate


Variables representing dimensional vertical coordinates for or height must always explicitly include the  **`units`** attribute.
The acceptable units for a vertical (depth or height) coordinate variable must a UDUNITS <<UDUNITS>> representation of one of the following:

* units of pressure.
For vertical axes the most commonly used of these include **`bar`**, **`millibar`**, **`decibar`**, **`atmosphere (atm)`**, **`pascal (Pa)`**, and **`hPa`**.
* units of length.
For vertical axes the most commonly used of these include **`meter (metre, m)`**, and **`kilometer (km)`**.
* other units that may under certain circumstances reference vertical position such as units of density or temperature.

Plural forms are also acceptable.

[[dimensionless-vertical-coordinate, Section 4.3.2, "Dimensionless Vertical Coordinate"]]
==== Dimensionless Vertical Coordinate

The **`units`** attribute is not required for dimensionless coordinates.
For backwards compatibility with COARDS we continue to allow the **`units`** attribute to take one of the values: **`level`**, **`layer`**, or **`sigma_level`**.
These values are not recognized by the UDUNITS package, and are considered a deprecated feature in the CF standard.

[[parametric-vertical-coordinate, Section 4.3.3, "Parametric Vertical Coordinate"]]
==== Parametric Vertical Coordinate

In some cases dimensional vertical coordinates are a function of horizontal location as well as parameters which depend on vertical location, and therefore cannot be stored in the one-dimensional vertical coordinate variable, which is in most of these cases is dimensionless.
The `standard_name` of the parametric (usually dimensionless) vertical coordinate variable can be used to find the definition of the associated computed (always dimensional) vertical coordinate in <<parametric-v-coord>>.
The definition provides a mapping between the parametric vertical coordinate values and computed values that can positively and uniquely indicate the location of the data.
The `formula_terms` attribute can be used to associate terms in the definitions with variables in a netCDF file, and the `computed_standard_name` attribute can be used to supply the `standard_name` of the computed vertical coordinate values computed according to the definition.
To maintain backwards compatibility with COARDS the use of these attributes is not required, but is strongly recommended.
Some of the definitions may be supplemented with information stored in the `grid_mapping` variable about the datum used as a vertical reference (e.g. geoid, other geopotential datum or reference ellipsoid; see <<grid-mappings-and-projections>> and <<appendix-grid-mappings>>).

[[atm-sigma-coord-ex]]
[caption="Example 4.3. "]
.Atmosphere sigma coordinate
====

----
float lev(lev) ;
  lev:long_name = "sigma at layer midpoints" ;
  lev:positive = "down" ;
  lev:standard_name = "atmosphere_sigma_coordinate" ;
  lev:formula_terms = "sigma: lev ps: PS ptop: PTOP" ;
  lev:computed_standard_name = "air_pressure" ;
----

====

In this example the **`standard_name`** value **`atmosphere_sigma_coordinate`** identifies the following definition from <<parametric-v-coord>> which specifies how to compute pressure at gridpoint **`(n,k,j,i)`** where **`j`** and **`i`** are horizontal indices, **`k`** is a vertical index, and **`n`** is a time index:

----
p(n,k,j,i) = ptop + sigma(k)*(ps(n,j,i)-ptop)
----

The **`formula_terms`** attribute associates the variable **`lev`** with the term **`sigma`**, the variable **`PS`** with the term **`ps`**, and the variable **`PTOP`** with the term **`ptop`**.
Thus the pressure at gridpoint **`(n,k,j,i)`** would be calculated by 

----
p(n,k,j,i) = PTOP + lev(k)*(PS(n,j,i)-PTOP)
----

The `computed_standard_name` attribute indicates that the values in variable
`p` would have a `standard_name` of `air_pressure`.

[[time-coordinate, Section 4.4, "Time Coordinate"]]
=== Time Coordinate

A time coordinate is a number which identifies an instant along the continuous physical dimension of time, whether in reality or a model.
The instant can equivalently be identified by its date/time at 0 `degrees_east`, specified by a set of numbers comprising year, month, day, hour, minute and second, where the second may have a fraction but the others are all integer.
The time coordinate and the date/time are interconvertible (see <<calendar>>).

Variables containing time coordinates must always explicitly include the **`units`** attribute, formatted as described in <<time-coordinate-units>>.
There is no default value for the **`units`**.
A time coordinate is identifiable from its **`units`** alone.
Optionally, a time coordinate may be indicated additionally by providing the **`standard_name`** attribute with an appropriate value, and/or the **`axis`** attribute with the value **`T`**.

[[time-axis-ex]]

.Time axis
====

----
double time(time) ;
  time:long_name = "time" ;
  time:units = "days since 1990-1-1 0:0:0" ;
----

====


[[time-coordinate-units, Section 4.4.1, "Time coordinate units"]]
==== Time coordinate units

The **`units`** attribute of a time coordinate variable takes a string value that follows the formatting requirements of the <<UDUNITS>> package.
It must comprise a unit of measure that is physically equivalent to the SI base unit of time (i.e. the second), followed by the word **`since`** and a reference date/time.

The acceptable units of measure for time are given by UDUNITS.
The most commonly used of these strings (and their abbreviations) includes **`day`** (**`d`**), **`hour`** (**`hr`**, **`h`**), **`minute`** (**`min`**) and **`second`** (**`sec`**, **`s`**).
Plural forms are also acceptable.

UDUNITS defines a **`year`** to be exactly 365.242198781 days (the interval between 2 successive passages of the sun through vernal equinox).
__It is not a calendar year.__ UDUNITS defines a  **`month`** to be exactly **`year/12`**, which is __not a calendar month__.
The CF standard follows UDUNITS in the definition of units, but we recommend that **`year`** and **`month`** should not be used, because of the potential for mistakes and confusion.

UDUNITS permits a number of alternatives to the word **`since`** in the units of time coordinates. All the alternatives have exactly the same meaning in UDUNITS. For compatibility with other software, CF strongly recommends that `since` should be used.

The reference date/time string (appearing after the identifier **`since`**) is required.
It may include date alone, or date and time, or date, time and time zone.
Its format is _y_-_m_-_d_ [_H_:_M_:_S_ [_Z_]], where [...] indicates an optional element,

* _y_ is year, _m_ month, _d_ day, _H_ hour and _M_ minute, which are all integers of one or more digits, and _y_ may be prefixed with a sign (but note that some CF calendars do not permit negative years; see <<calendar>>),

* _S_ is second, which may be integer or floating point,

* _Z_ is the time zone.

The default time zone is the one centred on 0 `degrees_east` of longitude, and if both time and time zone are omitted the time is 00:00:00 (midnight, the start of the day) in the default time zone.
Thus, **`units = "days since 1990-1-1"`** means the same as **`units = "days since 1990-1-1 0:0:0"`**.

The time zone _Z_ has four possible formats, any of which may be prefixed with a sign:

** _H_, the hour alone, of one or two digits e.g. **`-6`**, **`2`**, **`+11`**, which is sufficient for many time zones.

** _H_:_M_, where _H_ is hour and _M_ minute, each of one or two digits, e.g. **`5:30`**.

** four digits, of which the first pair are the hours and the second the minutes e.g. **`0530`**.

** three digits, of which the first is the hour (0--9) e.g. **`530`**.

For example, **`seconds since 1992-10-8 15:15:42.5 -6:00`** indicates seconds since October 8th, 1992 at 3 hours, 15 minutes and 42.5 seconds in the afternoon, in the time zone which is centred on -90 `degrees_east` of longitude, six hours behind the default time zone.
Subtracting the time zone from the date/time specified converts it to the default time zone e.g. **`1989-12-31 18:00:00 -6`** identifies the same instant as **`1990-1-1 0:0:0`**.


[[calendar, Section 4.4.2, "Calendar"]]
==== Calendar

In order to calculate a time coordinate value from a date/time, or the reverse, one must know the **`units`** attribute of the time coordinate variable (containing the time unit of the coordinate values and the reference date/time, see <<time-coordinate-units>>) and the calendar, indicated by the **`calendar`** attribute.
The choice of calendar defines the set of dates (year-month-day combinations) which are permitted, and therefore it specifies the number of days between the times of **`0:0:0`** (midnight) on any two dates.
Date/times which are not permitted in a given calendar are prohibited both in the time coordinate values, and in the reference date/time string.
It is recommended that the calendar be specified by the **`calendar`** attribute of the time coordinate variable.

The values currently defined for **`calendar`** are listed below.
The lengths of the months are the same as in the Gregorian calendar in all calendars except **`360_day`**, **`none`** (see <<none-calendar>>) and explicitly defined calendars (see <<explicit-calendar>>).
The calendars differ in their treatment of leap years and leap seconds (see <<leap-seconds>>).
Leap seconds are adjustments occasionally made in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
When a positive leap second is introduced at the end of a minute, that minute contains 61 seconds.
If a negative leap second were introduced (there have been none up to now), the minute would contain 59 seconds.

In the **`julian`** and the default **`standard`** mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar, dates in years before year 0 (i.e. before 0-1-1 0:0:0) are not allowed, and the year in the reference date/time of the units must not be negative.
In these calendars, year zero has a special use to indicate a climatology (see <<climatological-statistics>>), but this use of year zero is deprecated.
In other calendars, year 0 is the year before year 1, and negative years are allowed.

**`standard`**:: Mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar as defined by UDUNITS.
This is the default.
A deprecated alternative name for this calendar is **`gregorian`**.
In this calendar, date/times after (and including) 1582-10-15 0:0:0 are in the Gregorian calendar, in which a year is a leap year if either (i) it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 or (ii) it is divisible by 400.
Date/times before (and excluding) 1582-10-5 0:0:0 are in the Julian calendar.
Year 1 AD or CE in the **`standard`** calendar is also year 1 of the **`julian`** calendar.
In the **`standard`** calendar, 1582-10-15 0:0:0 is exactly 1 day later than 1582-10-4 0:0:0 and the intervening dates are undefined.
Therefore it is recommended that date/times in the range from (and including) 1582-10-5 0:0:0 until (but excluding) 1582-10-15 0:0:0 should not be used as reference in **`units`**, and that a time coordinate variable should not include any date/times in this range, because their interpretation is unclear.
It is also recommended that a reference date/time before the discontinuity should not be used for date/times after the discontinuity, and vice-versa.
See also <<leap-seconds>>.

**`proleptic_gregorian`**:: A calendar with the Gregorian rules for leap-years extended to dates before 1582-10-15.
All dates consistent with these rules are allowed, both before and after 1582-10-15 0:0:0.
See also <<leap-seconds>>.

**`julian`**:: Julian calendar, in which a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, even if it is also divisible by 100.
See also <<leap-seconds>>.

**`utc`**:: A Gregorian calendar __with__ leap seconds that is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and is valid from 1958-01-01 0:0:0; earlier date/times are not allowed in this calendar.
Date/times in the future are not allowed in this calendar, because it is unknown when future leap seconds will occur.
When a date/time is converted to a time coordinate value or vice-versa in this calendar, any leap seconds (positive or negative) must be counted that occurred in the interval between the date/time and the reference date/time in the **`units`**.
A date/time in the **`utc`** calendar represents an instant that is earlier than the same date/time in the **`tai`** calendar, by the net number of leap seconds introduced since the start of 1958.

**`tai`**:: A Gregorian calendar __without__ leap seconds that is based on International Atomic Time (TAI), and is valid from 1958-01-01 0:0:0; earlier date/times are not allowed in this calendar.
A date/time in the **`tai`** calendar represents an instant that is later than the same date/time in the **`utc`** calendar, by the net number of leap seconds introduced since the start of 1958. 

**`noleap`** or **`365_day`**:: A calendar with no leap years, i.e., all years are 365 days long, and there are no leap seconds.

**`all_leap`** or **`366_day`**:: A calendar in which every year is a leap year, i.e., all years are 366 days long, and there are no leap seconds.

**`360_day`**:: A calendar in which all years are 360 days, and divided into 30 day months, and there are no leap seconds.

**`none`**:: To be used when there is no annual cycle. See <<none-calendar>>.

Any other value may be given to the **`calendar`** attribute to describe an explicitly defined calendar. See <<explicit-calendar>>.


[[none-calendar, Section 4.4.4, "Time coordinates with no annual cycle"]]
==== Time coordinates with no annual cycle

The **`calendar`** attribute may be set to **`none`** in climate experiments that simulate a fixed time of year.
The time of year is indicated by the date in the reference time of the **`units`** attribute.
The time coordinates that might apply in a perpetual July experiment are given in the following example.

data:
  time = 0., 1., 2., ...;
----

====

Here, all days simulate the conditions of 15th July, so it does not make sense to give them different dates.
The time coordinates are interpreted as 0, 1, 2, etc. days since the start of the experiment.


[[explicit-calendar, Section 4.4.5, "Explicitly defined calendar"]]
==== Explicitly defined calendar

If none of the calendars defined in <<calendar>> applies (e.g., calendars appropriate to a different paleoclimate era), a calendar can be explicitly defined, in terms of permissible year-month-day combinations.
To do this, the lengths of each month are explicitly defined with the **`month_lengths`** attribute of the time axis:

**`month_lengths`**:: A vector of size 12, specifying the number of days in the months from January to December (in a non-leap year).

If leap years are included, then two other attributes of the time axis must also be defined:

**`leap_year`**:: An example of a leap year.
It is assumed that all years that differ from this year by a multiple of four are also leap years.
If this attribute is absent, it is assumed there are no leap years.

**`leap_month`**:: A value in the range 1-12, specifying which month is lengthened by a day in leap years (1=January).
If this attribute is not present, February (2) is assumed.
This attribute is ignored if **`leap_year`** is not specified.

When an explicitly defined calendar is being used, the calendar may be described by giving value not defined in <<calendar>> to the **`calendar`** attribute; alternatively, the attribute may be omitted.

[[leap-seconds, Section 4.4.3, "Leap Seconds"]]
==== Leap Seconds

Each calendar defines a set of valid year-month-day-hour-minute-second combinations, which we refer to as the calendar's "set of date/times".
The set of date/times of the **`utc`** calendar includes leap seconds, where by "set of date/times" we mean the complete 
The sets of date/times of all _other_ calendars, _except_ **`standard`**, **`proleptic_gregorian`**, and **`julian`**, do _not_ include leap seconds.
The **`standard`**, **`proleptic_gregorian`**, and **`julian`** calendars are special in that they can be used for sets of date/times either __with__ or __without__ leap seconds, 

For these calendars, there are the following cases:

1. **The calendar is being used for a set of date/times in which leap seconds do not exist.**
   This is the case for a model simulation that defines every day as having a constant length of 86400 seconds.

2. **The calendar is being used for a set of date/times in which leap seconds exist, and are correctly accounted for.**
   This could be the case for observations from a platform whose time recording equipment has prior knowledge of when new leap seconds are to be introduced and is able to apply a new leap second at the appropriate time.
   It could equally be the case for model whose timesteps include leap seconds.

3. **The calendar is being used for a set of date/times in which leap seconds exist, but some or all leap seconds might not have not been correctly accounted for.**
   This could be the case for observations from a platform whose time recording equipment has a delay in applying a new leap second.

4. **It may be unknown whether leap seconds exist in the set of date/times.**

In the **`standard`**, **`proleptic_gregorian`**, and **`julian`** calendars, when a time coordinate value is calculated from a date/time, or the reverse, it is assumed that the coordinate value increases by exactly 60 seconds from the start of any minute (identified by year, month, day, hour, minute, all being integers) to the start of the next minute.
In other words, leap seconds (positive or negative) are not counted, even if they exist.
When the these calendars are being be used for sets of date/times __with__ leap seconds (i.e. cases 2 and 3 and perhaps case 4), this assumption has the following consequences:

* Any date/times between the end of the 60th second of the last minute of one hour and the start of the first second of the next hour cannot be represented by time coordinates e.g. **`2016-12-31 23:59:60.5`** cannot be represented.
  
* A date/time in the excluded range must not be used as a reference date/time e.g. **`seconds since 2016-12-31 23:59:60`** is not a permitted value for **`units`**.

* If any leap seconds occurred between the reference date/time and the date/time represented by a time coordinate, the coordinate value does __not__ count the leap seconds (assuming that the leap seconds were known when the time coordinate was calculated).
  For instance, **`60 seconds after 23:59`** always means **`00:00`** on the next day, even if there was a leap second.
  In that situation, the coordinate value does not exactly equal the actual length of the interval of time between the two instants.
  By contrast, in case 1 (i.e. a set of date/times without leap seconds), the difference between two time coordinates is always equal to the length of time between the instants they represent, as is always true in all other calendars.
  It is important to be aware of this disadvantage of the **`standard`**, **`proleptic_gregorian`** and **`julian`** calendars when used with sets of date/times including leap seconds.
  If it is essential for leap seconds to be counted in time coordinates, so that they exactly equal time intervals, you must use the **`utc`** calendar.

An inaccuracy results from interpreting a time coordinate as a time interval if the interval includes leap seconds which were known when the time coordinate was calculated (case 2, and perhaps 3 and 4).
An inaccuracy results from converting a time coordinate to a date/time if the interval includes leap seconds which were _not_ known when the time coordinate was calculated (possible in case 3 or 4).
For many applications of the **`standard`**, **`proleptic_gregorian`**, and **`julian`** calendars, these inaccuracies are too small to matter, but there are some applications where they are important.
Therefore it is recommended that for each of these three calendars the appropriate treatment of leap seconds should be indicated by giving the time coordinate variable a **`units_metadata`** attribute containing a **`leap_seconds`** keyword with one of the permitted values **`none`**, **`utc**` or **`unknown`**.
**`none`** means that leap seconds do not exist in the set of date/times (i.e. case 1), **`utc`** means that leap seconds exist in the set of date/times and are correctly accounted for (i.e. case 2), and **`unknown`** means that the data-writer did not know or did not record whether the leap seconds exist in the set of date/times, nor how they are treated if they did exist (i.e. cases 3 and 4).
If the **`units_metadata`** attribute is not present, or does not contain the `leap_seconds` keyword, the data-reader should assume **`leap_seconds: unknown`**.
A variable's **`units_metadata`** attribute may only contain the **`leap_seconds`** keyword if the variable's calendar is one of **`standard`** , `proleptic_gregorian`, or **`julian`**.

Although the five time coordinates have the same value and reference date/time, they do not all refer to the same instant, as shown in the comments on their data values.
The value of **`1 second`** for **`time2`**, **`time4`** and **`time5`** can be correctly interpreted as the length of the interval from the reference date/time 2016-12-31 23:59:59 to the date/time indicated in their comments.
In the case of **`time3`**, the time coordinate is again **`1 second`** and represents 2017-1-1 0:0:0, but the interval between the reference date/time 2016-12-31 23:59:59 and 2017-1-1 0:0:0 is actually 2 seconds.
In the case of **`time1`**, we cannot convert the time coordinate to a date/time with certainty, and we do not know the exact length of the interval.

=== Discrete Axis

The spatiotemporal coordinates described in sections 4.1-4.4 are continuous variables, and other geophysical quantities may likewise serve as continuous coordinate variables, for instance density, temperature or radiation wavelength.
By contrast, for some purposes there is a need for an axis of a data variable which indicates either an ordered list or an unordered collection, and does not correspond to any continuous coordinate variable.
Consequently such an axis may be called {ldquo}discrete{rdquo}.
A discrete axis has a dimension but might not have a coordinate variable.
Instead, there might be one or more auxiliary coordinate variables with this dimension (see preamble to section 5).
Following sections define various applications of discrete axes, for instance section 6.1.1 {ldquo}Geographical regions{rdquo}, section 7.3.3 {ldquo}Statistics applying to portions of cells{rdquo}, section 9.3 {ldquo}Representation of collections of features in data variables{rdquo}.
